# Smart Heating Register

This is the Arudino code for my smart heating registers.  These use a NodeMCU or other compatible ESP8266-based wifi.  It provides simple serial and HTML-based interfaces for configuring the servos used to actuate the register dampers, and an web interface compatible with the HomeBridge HTTP plug-in for controlling them.

Details of the hardware project, including STL files for the 3D printed parts, [can be found on my site](http://www.tmproductions.com/projects-blog/2020/1/19/smart-heating-registers).
